# FFmpeg in Docker

FFmpeg compiled with additional libraries and running inside a Docker container. A RESTful API runs alongside written in Node.js utilsing `fluent-ffmpeg`.

For more informations read the [documentation](https://ryan.mccartney.info/ffmpeg-docker/).

## Pre-built Image

You can use the pre-built image straight away - however, this is contains pre-compiled FFmpeg as a result it does not have the following options enabled to comply with FFmpeg licensing;

-   `--enable-gpl`
-   `--enable-nonfree`
-   `--enable-libndi_newtek`
-   `--enable-decklink`

If this isn't a problem then you can get the image here;

`docker pull ghcr.io/ryanmccartney/ffmpeg-api:latest`

## Building

If you want to contribute to this project or you'd like some of the above features, you'll need to build a copy of this image yourself which will compile FFmpeg locally.

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/ryanmccartney/ffmpeg-docker`
2. Change directory to the repository `cd ./ffmpeg-docker`
3. Install the npm packages locally (as it's mounted into the container) `npm i`
4. Build the image using `docker compose build`.

### With Decklink Support

Before building you'll need to set the build argument variable `DECKLINK_SUPPORT` to `true`.

Additionally, you'll need to get a download link for the Blackmagic Design SDK from the [Blackmagic Website](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/download/2438c76b9f734f69b4a914505e50a5ab/Linux).

It'll come in the form `https://sw.blackmagicdesign.com/DeckLink/v12.x.x/Blackmagic_DeckLink_SDK_12.x.x.zip?Key-Pair-Id=VALUE==&Expires=VALUE`

Then set the build argument variable `DEKSTOP_VIDEO_SDK_URL` to this url.

When running the container you'll then need to pass through the device. To do this;

1. Install Decklink Driver on your host machine.
2. Check device is connected and update any firmware
3. Determine the Blackmagic device mapping on the host. Expect something like - `dev/blackmagic/dv0`.

### With NDI Support

Using a [patch](https://framagit.org/tytan652/ffmpeg-ndi-patch) to re-add Newtec NDI to FFmpeg on building.

Before building you'll need to set the build argument variable `NDI_SUPPORT` to `true`.

-   Work in progress
